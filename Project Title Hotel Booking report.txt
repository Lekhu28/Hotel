Project Title: Hotel Booking App using MERN Stack (React, Node.js, and MongoDB)

Introduction:
The Hotel Booking App is a web-based application that allows users to search for hotels, view hotel details, make bookings, and manage their bookings. The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes React.js for the front-end user interface, Node.js for the back-end server, and MongoDB for the database.

Technologies Used:

React.js: React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used in this project to create the interactive user interface for the hotel booking app. React components are used to create reusable UI elements such as search forms, hotel cards, and booking forms.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. In this project, Node.js is used to build the back-end server that handles API requests from the front-end, communicates with the database, and performs business logic such as handling hotel bookings.

Express.js: Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of server-side applications. It is used in this project to handle routing, create RESTful APIs, and manage middleware for handling authentication, validation, and error handling.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is used in this project to store hotel and booking data. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it suitable for handling large amounts of data in a fast and efficient manner.

Mongoose: Mongoose is a popular MongoDB library for Node.js that provides a higher-level abstraction for working with MongoDB. It is used in this project to define data models, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and establish relationships between data entities such as hotels and bookings.

Features:
The Hotel Booking App developed using the MERN stack includes the following features:

Hotel Search: Users can search for hotels by location, dates, and other criteria. The app displays a list of hotels that match the search criteria, along with their details such as name, image, price, and rating.

Hotel Details: Users can view detailed information about a hotel, including its amenities, room types, and availability. The app displays hotel images, description, and reviews from other users.

Booking Management: Users can create, view, update, and cancel hotel bookings. The app allows users to select room types, specify check-in and check-out dates, and provides a summary of the booking details before confirming the booking.

Authentication and Authorization: The app includes user authentication and authorization features. Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out. Only authenticated users can create and manage bookings. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.

Error Handling: The app includes error handling to provide a smooth user experience. It displays error messages for invalid input, server errors, and other issues that may occur during the booking process.

Conclusion:
The Hotel Booking App developed using the MERN stack is a fully functional web application that allows users to search for hotels, view hotel details, and make bookings. It includes authentication and authorization features for secure user management and error handling for smooth user experience. The MERN stack provides a robust and scalable framework for building modern web applications with JavaScript technologies.
